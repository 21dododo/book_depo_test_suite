# A test suite for the website "Book Depository"

The test suite includes:
1. Test plan document.
2. Test objectives table.
3. Test cases table.
4. UI tests using selenium and Pytest.


Walkthrough for running the tests:
1. Download the repository and open it in any code editor.
2. In the terminal write: pip install -r requirements 
3. In the terminal write: pytest 
4. If you want several tests to run in parallel, instead of step 3 write: pytest -n <number of tests in parallel> (ex: pytest -n 4)
